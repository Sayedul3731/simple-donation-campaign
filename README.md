## simple-donation-campaign

3 features explanation of my 'simple-donation-campaign' project:
* There is a navbar in my project where right side 3 menu pages 'Home', 'donation', 'statistics'
and left side a logo. When click on the 3 menu pages show the menu items individually. When click on 'Home' page
show the 'Home' page data and when click on the 'donation' page show the donation all data and when you click on the 'statistics' page show a dynamic pie chart.
There will show donated data and undonated data percentage.

* There is a banner section where is a search input field and 12 donation card in the 'Home' page.
When click on the individual card show the card details in the dynamic router. In details card have a 'Donate' button If you want to donate
just click on the 'Donate' button. When click on the 'Donate' button show a toast 'Thanks for donate' and at the same time the donated card 
add the 'donation' page.

* You know that when click on the 'Donate' button the card will add in the 'donation' page.There will be almost 4 cards show in the 'donation'
 page but when you add more 'Donate' the card will not show in  the 'donation' page then show 4 cards and a 'Ses All' button. When you click
 on the 'See All' button show the all cards but at the same time the 'See All'
button will be hidden.
