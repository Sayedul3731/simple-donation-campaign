# simple-donation-campaign

3 features explanation of my 'simple-dontaion-campaign' project:
* there is a navbar in my project where right side 3 menu pages 'Home', 'donation', 'statistics'
and left side one logo. When click on the 3 menu pages show the menu items individually. When click on 'Home' page
show the 'Home' page data and when click on the 'donation' page show the donation all data.

* There is a banner section where is a search input field and 12 donation card in the 'Home' page.
When click on the individual card show the card details in the dynamic router. In details card have a 'donate' button If you want to donate
just click on the 'Donate' button. When click on the 'Donate' button show a toast 'Thanks for donate' and at the same time the donated card 
add the 'donation' page.

* You know that when click on the 'Donate' button the card will add in the 'donation' page.There will be almost 4 cards show in the 'donation'
 page but when you add more 'Donate' the card will not show in  the 'donation' page then show 4 cards and a 'Ses All' button. When you click
 on the 'See All' button show the all cards but at the same time the 'See All'
button will be hidden.
